    <p class="project-description short">
      Security is often found in informal ways. I explored infrastructure of care specifically focusing on security as
a form of care. an object of study that I examined specifically from a planning perspective. By activating the
night-time economy of the area, a crucial sticky space is introduced: one which encourages natural surveillance
as the most effective and reliable form of security. Additionally, involving a number of other informal
security measures: a powerful light source, an ideal location to stop and feel assured as well as a good light
source and importantly without enforcing artificial surveillance or changing the existing landscape of successful
daytime trade. Caring by providing a source of security through design.

<p>Security is often found in informal ways. I explored infrastructure of care specifically focusing on security as
a form of care. an object of study that I examined specifically from a planning perspective. By activating the
night-time economy of the area, a crucial sticky space is introduced: one which encourages natural surveillance
as the most effective and reliable form of security. Additionally, involving a number of other informal
security measures: a powerful light source, an ideal location to stop and feel assured as well as a good light

daytime trade. Caring by providing a source of security through design.

<p>
Through extensive site visits, i explore the difference between the market, espessically the front of the market
consisting of the two canopies, i find that during the day the market espesically these front canopies are thriving
with plenty of people from various cultures, shopping and serving. however during the evening this space
completly transforms to an empty dark space. (far right) the building of shutters shows a response to my initial
reaction to the area of upton park, i felt that the are was littered with shutters especially consisting of graffiti
tagging.
</p>
<p>
Separating the canopys into two zones, blue for food while red signifies the activity area. The encouragement and implementation of natural surveillance is key in ensuring the most effective and
low-maintenance form of security, since traditional surveillance methods risk imposing a menacing impression. By providing light, specifically lights shining various colours, it becomes a multi purpose device, lights can
change depending on the situation, but importantly by choice.</p>
