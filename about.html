      <h2>About Me</h2>
      
      <p>
        I'm Alex Valentine Evdokimov, My academic and professional journey has nurtured a strong interest in public infrastructure and cultural architecture, with a focus on the user experience, material expression, and long-term adaptability. In my final year at the AA I explored architecture as a process rather than a product, using timber as both a conceptual and material tool to rethink the suburban house through site-specific interventions that emerged in communication with natural resource flows. As part of this project, I developed a speculative toolkit of construction details using irregular timber components extracted from continuous cover forests in Thetford, for application within standardised housing contexts. 
         </p>
  <p>
    I bring a wide range of professional experience, including my time at Spencer Fung Architects, where I worked at Stage 3 on a spa complex in Australia, producing plans, elevations, and 3D visualisations for both architecture and bespoke furniture. As a freelance designer, I collaborated with the Anglo-Belarusian Society to redevelop a derelict loft into a cultural library and gallery. I produced measured drawings, visuals for funding applications, and provided ongoing consultation during early construction phases. These roles demanded design flexibility as the project evolved alongside various practical constraints, which was a valuable first-hand exercise in remaining adaptable and prioritising effective communication, particularly due to the immediate and practical nature of the responsibilities I took on.
 </p>
  <p>
    I am proficient in Rhino, V-Ray, Adobe Creative Suite, and hand drawing: the latter of which demonstrates my love of – and dedication to - the close details, coordinating the slow emergence of a broader creative vision. I am especially drawn to practices that embrace adaptive reuse, material character, and thoughtful design processes – qualities I have been drawn to across multiple Sheppard Robson projects I have come across.
